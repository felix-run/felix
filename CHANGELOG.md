## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Fixed an unauthenticated remote code execution path.** `spec.mcp_servers` entries
  with `transport: stdio` carry a manifest-supplied `command`, `args`, `cwd`, and `env`
  that reached `create_subprocess_exec` **at compile time**, so resolving a manifest ran
  the command — and the child inherited the API process environment (model API keys, the
  Postgres URL, cloud credentials). Writing such a manifest needed only the tenant-level
  `manifests:write` scope, and the shipped Compose defaults (`FELIX_AUTH_MODE=none` +
  `FELIX_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` + a `0.0.0.0` publish) meant it needed no credentials at
  all. stdio is now **disabled unless `FELIX_MCP_STDIO_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` names the exact
  commands allowed**; the check runs on manifest write, at compile, and at spawn. The
  child no longer inherits the parent environment — it gets `PATH`/`HOME`/`LANG`/`LC_ALL`/
  `TZ` plus the keys the ref declares — and loader variables (`LD_PRELOAD`, `PYTHONPATH`,
  `NODE_OPTIONS`, …) are rejected outright.
- **`FELIX_AUTH_MODE=none` is now refused on any non-loopback bind**, in every
  environment. `FELIX_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` relaxes the environment check only; it is no
  longer a way to serve an unauthenticated API to a network.

### Changed

- **Secure-by-default local stack (breaking).** `FELIX_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`
  (containers still set `0.0.0.0` explicitly), Compose defaults to
  `FELIX_AUTH_MODE=api_key` with `FELIX_ALLOW_INSECURE=false`, and the API port publishes
  on `127.0.0.1` (override with `FELIX_BIND_ADDR`). `make up` now runs
  `scripts/dev-key.sh`, which generates a local API key into `.env` on first run and
  prints it, so the quickstart stays one command. Existing deployments that relied on
  anonymous access must set an auth mode or bind loopback.
- `felix doctor` reports the stdio allowlist and fails the loopback check when
  `auth_mode=none` is paired with a public bind.

### Added

- Security scanning: CodeQL, a `pip-audit` CVE check over the locked
  dependency set (all extras), a gitleaks secret scan of the full history, and
  a Trivy scan of the image CI builds.
- Test coverage is measured and gated at the current 60%, ratcheted upward
  deliberately rather than set aspirationally.
- `tests/unit/test_invariants.py` — the repo rules are now enforced rather than
  documented: `.env.example` covers every `Settings` field, no optional
  dependency is imported at module scope, every Postgres-touching module has a
  `memory://` path, and the governance wrapper order in `builder.py` is fixed.
- `scripts/lean-import-check.py` and a CI `lean` job that imports all 156
  modules with no extras installed — the default image's promise, checked.
- `scripts/validate-toolkit.py` and a CI `toolkit` job; `.claude/**` and
  `CLAUDE.md` are now inside the CI path filter instead of bypassing every gate.
- Six settings that existed only in `config.py` are documented in
  `.env.example`: `FELIX_DATABASE_RLS`, `FELIX_SCALE_OUT`, `FELIX_REPLICA_ID`,
  `FELIX_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, `FELIX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `FELIX_POLICY_BUNDLE_PUBKEY`
  (the last is declared but not yet consumed by any code path).
- GitHub Actions are pinned by commit SHA, and all container base/service
  images by digest, so a rebuild is reproducible and a retagged upstream image
  cannot change what ships.
- `scripts/test.sh` — the canonical test entry point. It sets the in-memory
  store environment the suite is designed for; `make test` and CI both use it.
- `pre-commit` now runs in CI, so the hook config cannot silently break again.
- `.editorconfig` matching the ruff configuration.
- `make type` now says what to do when the optional extras are missing instead
  of printing 27 unresolved-import errors.

### Changed

- Dependabot: weekly grouped updates for actions and images; the docker
  ecosystem now points at `deploy/docker` (the previous `/` entry matched
  nothing — there is no Dockerfile at the repo root).
- Builder image `uv` 0.9 → 0.12, `ty` 0.0.73 → 0.0.74, and the Docker build
  caches uv downloads between builds.
- Relicensed from MIT to Apache License 2.0 (adds an express patent grant and
  a trademark carve-out; contributions are inbound under the same license).
  Adds a `NOTICE` file; releases published under MIT remain MIT.

### Fixed

- The runtime image no longer ships `pip`. Its vendored copies of `msgpack`
  and `setuptools` carried HIGH CVEs (GHSA-6v7p-g79w-8964, CVE-2025-47273)
  even though neither is a Felix dependency; the venv is built by uv in the
  builder stage, so the runtime never needed pip. The runtime stage also
  applies pending OS security updates, clearing four util-linux CVEs that
  `python:3.14-slim` has not picked up yet. The image scans clean.
- `pre-commit install` failed for every contributor: the ruff repo entry was
  missing its `https://github.com/` prefix, so hook installation could never
  clone it. `pre-commit validate-config` passes on the broken file — only
  `install-hooks` surfaces it.
- `make check` failed on any machine with a `.env`: the pytest leg inherited
  `FELIX_DATABASE_URL` and ran against a real Postgres, and `make type`
  checked `tests/` while CI checks only `packages apps`.
- The Docker build no longer falls back to an unfrozen `uv sync`, which could
  silently produce an image from a different dependency resolution than CI
  tested. CI now also verifies `uv.lock` is current and installs `--frozen`.
- Taskiq worker no longer dies on idle BRPOP (`redis-py` 8 default
  `socket_timeout=5`); broker/result backend use `socket_timeout=None`.
- Scheduler entrypoint awaits `run_scheduler` via `asyncio.run` (taskiq 0.12+).
- Worker/scheduler Compose healthchecks disabled (image probe targets API `/health`).

### Changed

- Session leases prefer Redis (with in-process fallback) so exclusive/shared
  attach works across API replicas.

### Added

- Session control routes: snapshots, FTS search, abort/continue, thinking
  levels, leases, compact, UI prompts, JSONL export (see README Protocols).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-22

### Added

- Initial public release of **Felix** — self-hostable managed agents harness
  (`apiVersion: felix/v1`).
- Surfaces: `/chat`, OpenAI-compatible `/v1`, A2A, MCP, management APIs.
- Lean Docker Compose (api, worker, **scheduler**, Postgres+pgvector, Valkey)
  with optional MinIO (`--profile full`).
- Helm chart with PVC support, consumer shared secret, scheduler container, and
  pre-install/pre-upgrade **migrate Job**.
- Durable fibers, audit spill to DuckDB (optional), JWT/api_key auth, plugins seam.
- Durable **usage meters** (`usage_events`) flushed by the worker; `GET /usage`.
- Eval **fixture + `--mock`** path for CI (`fixtures/eval/smoke.json`).
- Chat **history** (`GET`/`DELETE /chat/history/{thread_id}`) and **audit metrics**.
- Response aliases (`events`/`plans`/`requests`/`manifests`/`datasets`) for chat-ui clients.
- CLI: `migrate`, `eval`, `mint-jwt`, `bundle-manifests`, `doctor`, `version`, `temporal-worker`.
- Typed packages (`py.typed`) for harness, CLI, API, and worker.
