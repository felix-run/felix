"""Resilience composites — what a model client does when a provider lets it down.

Lifted out of `patterns/model.py`, whose subject is routing, metering and the provider
factories. Failing over to another model and escalating to a stronger one are the same
kind of decision as each other and a different kind from either of those: a policy about
what to do when an answer is unavailable or not good enough.

Both wrap a `ModelClient` and are themselves `ModelClient`s, so `build_model` composes them
around whatever `build_one_model` produced without either knowing about the other.

One property both share and neither can express in a type: they define `stream_turn`
unconditionally, so `supports_stream_turn` answers True for a composite whatever its
members do. That is why each has to settle a turn its members cannot stream, rather than
leaving the caller to notice — see `_FallbackClient.stream_turn`.
